# AM-Bench 2022 Demonstration Scripts

## Description

<!-- Required. Please replace the text in this section with a
     summary of the work this repository represents, or intends
     to. Sub-sections describing file contents can/should be
     removed, or replaced with a file format or folder hierarchy
     description. -->

This repository contains scripts and supporting information for 
a set of demonstrations related to the 2022 AM-Bench challenge series.

In particular, the data used in this demonstration comes from the
2018 AM-Bench challenge documented at https://www.nist.gov/ambench/amb2018-02-description.

The script queries the AM-Bench 2018 repository located at https://ambench.nist.gov/, 
then processes the returned XML-based results, does some image processing, and
generates plots of melt pool depths.

Additional datasets and challenge problem documentation are available through the NIST
Public Data Repository record at https://data.nist.gov/od/id/6D6EC9B3A4147BE2E05324570681EEC91931
with an associated publication (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-020-00169-1)
documenting the experiments.

### CODEOWNERS

This template repository includes a file named
[CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS), which visitors can view to discover
which GitHub users are "in charge" of the repository. More
crucially, GitHub uses it to assign reviewers on pull requests.
GitHub documents the file (and how to write one) [here][gh-cdo].

***Please update this file*** to point to your own account or
team, so that the [Open-Source Team][gh-ost] doesn't get spammed
with spurious review requests. *Thanks!*
