<h1>Getting started: Astronomy Teaching</h1>

This folder contains examples of Python notebooks for use in astronomy. 

It contains two folders:

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>astro101</code></strong> contains an example Python notebook in which students plot thousands of galaxy positions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to discover the large-scale structure of the Universe. The activity is designed for Astronomy 101 students, to be done in 5-10 minutes in a large lecture setting, or as assigned homework.</li>
	<li><strong><code>labs</code></strong> contains a structured series of Python notebooks designed for an upper-level undergraduate astronomy lab course.</li>
</ul>

Remember that you can run these scripts here, and make changes to them, but you cannot save your changes in this read-only Data Volume. To save your changes, copy these scripts into your <strong><code>persistent</code></strong> folder, either using the <em>Files</em> tab of your dashboard or with a Terminal command.

There are also additional education activities in the <strong><code>Teaching</code></strong> folder one level below the main getting_started volume.
