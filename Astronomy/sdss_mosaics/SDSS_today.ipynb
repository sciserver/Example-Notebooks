    "## Retrieving Data from an Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the first bit of Montage processing.  Montage uses standard FITS files throughout and FITS files have all the metadata describing the image (for us that mainly means pixel scale, projection type and center, rotation and so on).  To drive the processing we need a \"FITS header\" specification from the user, which we capture in a header \"template\" file that looks just like a FITS header though with newlines (FITS headers have fixed 80-character card images with no line breaks).  The mHdr routine is a utility that creates a simple FITS header template with limited control over all the above (<i>e.g.</i> the projection is always gnomonic (TAN)).  Other common options are to use a header extracted from some pre-existing FITS file (to create a matching mosaic) or to use mMakeHdr, which fits a bounding box around a set of images (usually the ones you are about to mosaic).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the location and size to retrieve the data we want from a remote archive.  Montage provides an image metadata search service (using mSearch &mdash; a very fast R-Tree / memory-mapped utility &mdash; for most datasets).  This service returns URLs for all the images covering the region of interest, which are then downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways to find images.  The International Virtual Astronomy Alliance (IVOA) has developed a couple of standards for querying metadata (Simple Image Access: SIAP and Table Access Protocol: TAP) which many data providers support.  Our service is focused on a few large uniform datasets (2MASS, DSS, SDSS, WISE).  Other datasets require more care.  For instance, simply downloading all pointed observations of a specific region for a non-survey instrument will include a wide range of integration times (and therefore noise levels) and the mosaicking should involve user-specified weighting of the images (which Montage supports but does not define)."

For a subset of projections (specifically where both the source and destination are tangent-plane projections) we can use a custom plane-to-plane algorithm developed by the Spitzer Space Telescope).  While mProjectPP only supports a subset of cases, they are extremely common ones.  mProjectPP is also flux conserving.\n",

    "mProjExec is a wrapper around the three main reprojection routines that determines whether mProjectPP or mProject should be used for each image (unless overridden with mProjectQL as here).  There is one final twist:  FITS headers allow for distortion parameters.  While these were introduced to deal with instrumental distortions, we can often use them to mimic an arbitrary projection over a small region with a distorted gnomonic projection.  This allows us to use mProjectPP over a wider range of cases and still have flux conservation with increased speed."

    "FITS files are binary data structures. To see the image we need to render to a JPEG or PNG form.  This involves choosing a stretch, color table (if it is a single image as here) and so on.  Montage provides a general visualization tool (mViewer) which can process a single image or multiple images for full color.  It supports overlays of various sorts.  One of its most useful features is a custom stretch algorithm which is based on gaussian-transformed histogram equalization, optionally with an extra logarithmic transform for really bright excursions.  A large fraction of astronomical images share the general characteristics of having a lot of pixels with something like a gaussian distribution at a low flux level (either background noise of low-level sky structure) coupled with a long histogram tail of very bright point-like sources.  If we apply our algorithm to this, stretching from the -2 or -1 \"sigma\" value of the low-level distribution to the image brightness maximum we usually get a good balance of seeing the low-level structure while still seeing the structure and brightness variations of the bright sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "mViewer specifications can become quite lengthy so the module provides three entry mechanisms.  The most terse (used here) is a \"parameter string\" based on the command-line arguments of the original stand-alone C program.
